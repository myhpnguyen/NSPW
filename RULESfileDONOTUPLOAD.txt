This is going to be the rules file where we have our github rules. I'll also post this to discord. 
These aren't set it stone but we do need a push standard otherwise this could end up quite chaotic for My's github. 

1.If you make significant changes try to notify My or who ever is currently in charge of the major repo of what those changes are. 
This is so that when the others come to pull the repo we're not totally lost. I Suggest we do this on discord and upload the logs here so we're not completely lost.

2.If you're making a major functionality change, write it down. 
This doesn't have to be an amazingly detailed description, but it should be meaningful enough the rest of the group can tell what functionality you're changing. 
An example is if you're adding multiple other files from the tutorial to progress the project. 

3.If you break it leave a note in discord and say what you think is broken. 
if we upload something and it ends up breaking something, don't hate the person hate the problem. If there's more then one of us we may be able to troubleshoot 
Faster then just one of us. 

4.If you have a solution @ My or the admin so we can try an upload as soon as possible after we do a breif run through of the logic. 
We're going to break something at some point, but we can fix it. 

5.Don't fork. 
We want to centralize as much as possible for now. 

If you want something added or changed just let me know.
